      Marci Lustra is looking to find the exit from the Void.
  
      This is no place for a fox.
  
      The game requires I make massive sacrifices to progress.
  
      A fox has abandoned the need to prove itself to others
  
      A fox only desires to make things and solve problems.
  
      A fox will be better at this. Or die trying!
